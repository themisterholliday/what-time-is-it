# What Time Is It
What time is it is a small website to mimick the functionality of [time.is](time.is).

It uses [Day.js](https://github.com/iamkun/dayjs) instead of [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) since [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) is being depreciated.

The site is also built using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)

You can see this site built and used in our YouTube videos below:
- [Building a website with Parcel]()
- [Deploying a website with Netlify]()
